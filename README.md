# SCS-R
Shortest common superstring with its reversals :)  
## Abstract  
Here we have implemented an approximate greedy algorithm for shortest common superstrings with reversals. This problem is a bit different from the original problem mentioned in [1]. The difference is that in this problem if the superstring also contains the reverse of the given set of strings it's also accepeted.
